# Chris Johnson's HTML Project Template
### Version 2.0 | By [Chris Johnson](http://chrisltd.com) | https://github.com/ChrisLTD/html_template

This is the project template I start with when creating new website templates from scratch. Itâ€™s currently designed to work with Bryan Jones's brilliant [CodeKit App](http://incident57.com/codekit/) for converting and merging SCSS files into a single `styles.css` stylesheet as well as minifying javascript into a `filename-ck.js` files. It should work equally well with any other SASS/SCSS processor as long as they are set to compile `scss/styles.scss` into `css/styles.css`.

*Note: the gitignore file is set to ignore compiled css and javascript files.*
